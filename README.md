# potential-doodle

Potential-doodle is intended to be a program into which one can fairly easily input a description of a language together with a bilingual dictionary which can then be used to generate translations of various annotated texts or to generate random sentences and their translations for various purposes, particularly amusement and attempting to become fluent.

At present the system is relatively incomplete and many parts are in a state of flux, particularly the user interface. Brief descriptions of all the files can be found in [Map.md](Map.md) and the current todo list in [TODO.md](TODO.md).

The primary functionality (mostly [here](compilelang.py) and [here](datatypes.py)) appears to be complete, though it ought to be tested on a larger scale and optimized substantially.
