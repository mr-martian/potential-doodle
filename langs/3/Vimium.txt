The Legend of the Young Man


There was a young, foolish man who thought he could pass by them.  


Legend foretold that anyone who could outsmart the guards would be allowed to pass onto the Bridge and obtain magical powers.


He came upon the first guard, who told him a riddle: 


“What is created as soon as you say it?”


“Noise,” the man said, confident.


Having outsmarted the first guard, the man passed onto the second. 


The second guard said,


“What pulls with no hands and glows without fire?”  
 
“The moon,” said the man.


The man climbed the Bridge and made it to the mountain man’s palace. 


The mountain man told him, “Now, you have two choices: you can either be granted wisdom or the power of flight.”


The man, thinking this was another test, told the mountain man, “Wisdom.”
And so the mountain man gave the man wisdom.


The man exclaimed in realization with his newfound wisdom, “Wisdom can be gained through experience, but flight cannot be!”
